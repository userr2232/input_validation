# Input validation

I use the module [PyInputPlus](https://pyinputplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) for input validation.

## Installation

To run the python scripts you must have installed [PyInputPlus](https://pyinputplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). This can be done with just:

```
pip3 install pyinputplus
```

I ran into some issues with Python 3.6.9. If that happens to you too, I recommend using Python 3.7. I am currently using Python 3.7.4.

## Multiplication Quiz

Is a microproject which asks the user a series of multiplication questions.
